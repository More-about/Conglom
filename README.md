# AutoDD
Automatically does the "due diligence" for you. 

If you want to know what stocks people are talking about in r/pennystocks over 
at Reddit, this is the tool for you. 

## Installation
There is a ``Pipfile`` for pipenv, if you are into that. It was automatically 
generated by Pycham. I personally simply installed ``psaw`` in my Python 
environment

## Running
Simply type in:

    python3 AutoDD.py

It will output the most frequently discussed 3-4 letter full-cap words in
r/pennystocks

## Example output

    Code    Frequency
    MVIS    198
